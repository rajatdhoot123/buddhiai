The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe  rusting  of  iron  can  be  prevented  by  painting,  oiling,  greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.","metadata":{"source":"blob","blobType":"","pdf_numpages":21,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1167,"to":1184}}}}],["48",{"pageContent":"3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe  rusting  of  iron  can  be  prevented  by  painting,  oiling,  greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby  coating  them  with  a  thin  layer  of  zinc.  The  galvanised  article  is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand  strong.  When  iron  is  mixed  with  nickel  and  chromium,  we  get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change.
